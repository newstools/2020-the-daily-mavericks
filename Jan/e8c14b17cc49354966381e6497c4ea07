As the virus has spread in China and beyond despite travel restrictions and other worldwide efforts to contain the disease, airlines suspended and chains including McDonald’s Corp. and KFC have shut locations. Volkswagen AG, Canadian insurer Sun Life Financial Inc. and banks from Credit Suisse Group to Morgan Stanley are telling staff to work from home. Here is a summary of how some of the biggest companies are responding to a crisis that is disrupting supply chains around the world: Wuhan, the epicenter, has more than 500 factories and other facilities, placing it 13th among 2,000 Chinese cities in Bloomberg’s supply chain database. It’s the capital of Hubei province, which has 1,016 facilities, making it seventh of 32 such jurisdictions. Many plants are in the auto and transportation industries. –With assistance from Leslie Patton, Mark Gurman, Richard Clough, Christopher Palmeri, Phil Kuntz, Mary Schlangenstein, Yukari Chilnik, Brian Moran, Kana Nishizawa, Jonathan Levin, Lisa Du, Grace Huang, Anna Kitanaka, Siraphob Thanthong-Knight, Kiuyan Wong, Masatsugu Horie, Cathy Chan, Christoph Rauwald, Doug Alexander, Justin Bachman and Brendan Case.
