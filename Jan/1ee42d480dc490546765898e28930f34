WUHAN, CHINA - JANUARY 21: (CHINA OUT) Lei Lei (not pictured) plays with a rat at home on January 21, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. He is a programmer at a technology company who raised three rats as pets. More than 30,000 years ago, Chinese ancestors invented the 10 Tian Gan and 12 Di Zhi. Later, people used 12 animals to symbolize the 12 earthly branches in order to make things easier to memorize. The animals in order are the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. China is marking the Spring Festival which begins with the Lunar New Year on January 25, 2020 ushering in the Year of the Rat.
