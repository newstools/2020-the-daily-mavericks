The Couleur gallery, in Stockholm’s upmarket Ostermalm district, was holding an exhibition of work by Dali containing around 10 pieces by the Spanish artist, news agency TT said. “They were worth 200,000 to 500,000 crowns ($21,000 to $52,000) each. So it’s quite a lot of money. It’s terrible.” gallery owner Peder Enstrom told TT. The works by Dali were on loan from Switzerland, he said. Police said the thieves smashed the glass entry doors of gallery and had made off with a number of pieces. “The scene has been cordoned off so that forensics can carry out an examination,” Stockholm police said in a statement. The police declined to give any further information. ($1 = 9.4970 Swedish crowns) (Reporting by Simon Johnson; Editing by Alison Williams) Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
