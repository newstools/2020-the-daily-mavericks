It seems he orchestrated this quite well. He wants to kill us! Why must he come to South Africa when France and Italy have the highest deaths???!”.

Such reports include articles by The Washington Post, Cape{town}etc and the Council on Foreign Relations.

He tweeted, “In a post-Covid South Africa, where unemployment is expected to pass the  40% mark & Nedbank expects that 1.6million South Africans added the queue of unemployment, #PutSouthAfricaFirst will have to be a bipartisan movement that is ground zero for all politicians.” echoing that putting South Africans first might be one of the ways to combat  the high unemployment rate.
