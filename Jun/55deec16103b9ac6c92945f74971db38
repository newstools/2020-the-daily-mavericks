Frittelli, who missed the cut at the Travelers Championship in Connecticut, is the fourth golfer to test positive since the elite U.S. Tour resumed on June 11. “I am experiencing no issues and feel great physically and was surprised and disappointed to learn of the positive test,” Frittelli said, adding that he would undergo a period of self-isolation. “I look forward to getting back on Tour once it’s safe to do so,” he said. The PGA Tour said in a statement https://www.pgatour.com/news/2020/06/28/pga-tour-statement-dylan-frittelli-covid-19-coronavirus-travelers-championship.html that it had carried out contact tracing after Frittelli returned the positive result, but was not recommending additional testing at this time.
