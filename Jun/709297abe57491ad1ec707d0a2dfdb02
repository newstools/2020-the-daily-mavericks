The reopening of global economies has turned into a tailwind for stocks, along with unprecedented levels of stimulus across the world. Wednesday’s advance was driven by financials, autos and durable goods manufacturers, indicating the rally is broadening out. Big tech shares lagged. “People are seeing the damage to the economy abate and investors now believe there is light at the end of tunnel,” Susan Schmidt, a portfolio manager at Aviva Investors Americas LLC, said on Bloomberg TV. “We will continue to see support for the stock market.” Next up comes the European Central Bank, which is expected to boost its rescue program Thursday. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition earlier agreed on a sweeping 130 billion-euro ($146 billion) stimulus package designed to spur short-term consumer spending and get businesses investing again. Meantime, tensions continue to simmer with the U.S. barring Chinese airlines in retaliation for Beijing ignoring the requests of American carriers to resume flights to China that had been suspended for the pandemic. Elsewhere, oil edged lower after trading close to its at highest level since early March amid optimism that OPEC+ will rebalance the market.
