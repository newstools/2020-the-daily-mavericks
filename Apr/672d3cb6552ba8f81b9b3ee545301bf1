Yogi Marcelle Webster took her business online at the start of the increased movement restrictions by government and has seen a rise in new students as more and more South Africans in lockdown seek means of staying healthy mentally and physically. The South African government is enforcing a 21 day total lockdown to try stem the spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 which causes the Covid-19 disease.

The temporary release of high demand spectrum will last for the duration of the national state of disaster declared by President Cyril Ramaphosa, said ICASA, as South Africa implements a 21-day lockdown from March 27 in a bid to curb infection rates. The emergency release is expected to ease network congestion and maintain the quality of broadband services in Africa’s most industrialised economy. Licencees are required to submit their applications to ICASA by April 9, the regulator added.
