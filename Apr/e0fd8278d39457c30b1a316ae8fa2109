Herbed buttermilk bread. (Photo: Tony Jackman)  Ingredients 500g self-raising flour 500g buttermilk Pinch of salt 25ml water Herbs of your choice, dried or fresh  Method Mix the ingredients and combine with herbs to taste, either dried or fresh from the garden, finely chopped. Pour 25ml water into the empty buttermilk carton and shake well and add this to the mixture. This adds a small amount of liquid to the mixture and “captures” any buttermilk left over in the carton. Place mixture in a well-greased bread tin, about 22cm x 12cm. Bake for 45 minutes at 180℃. Check the bread after 45 mins and judge whether you want to leave it in for an extra 10 mins to brown. TGIFood Tip: This is a sticky mixture which should be dropped into the baking tin and then smoothed with the back of a wooden spoon or plastic spatula. Do not try to flour it or shape into a ball. Variation Sprinkle the top of the dough with Parmesan. If you have dried olives, you can add those to the dough for a rich and exotic looking bread. TGIFood Tip If you can’t get hold of self-raising flour during the lockdown, make your own: For 500g flour, add 3 teaspoons of baking powder and one teaspoon of salt. Mix well.
