A South African resident of Ocean View Nadia Petersen poses for a photograph after her feeding program finished for the day in Ocean View, Cape Town. Petersen started the feeding program from her home in Ocean View which is one of the gang and crime hot spots in the city. Many impoverished residents rely on the one meal a day they receive from her due to the lack of jobs caused by the lockdown. Donations for Nadia Petersen's feeding scheme have been received from individuals across Cape Town who bring it to her home at 21 Mzar Crescent Ocean View.(Photo: EPA-EFE/NIC BOTHMA)        Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
