epa08372104 Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro waves to supporters during a rally in Brasilia, Brazil, 19 April 2020. Dozens of Brazilian gathered to show their support to Bolsonaro despite the coronavirus situation which, to date, reported 36,599 cases positives of COVID-19 in the country. EPA-EFE/Joedson Alves Bolsonaro has been tussling with Sergio Moro, who had appointed the police chief, Mauricio Valeixo. The political spat comes as the coronavirus outbreak begins to gather steam in Brazil, where Bolsonaro has faced widespread criticism for his handling of the outbreak. The firing of Valeixo caps the end of a turbulent 24 hours in the capital Brasilia. When news of Bolsonaro’s move to push out Valeixo emerged on Thursday, Moro considered quitting in protest, according to a source with knowledge of his plans. But later on Thursday, the two men appeared to have come to an understanding, and Moro said he would stay if he got to pick Valeixo’s successor, the same source said. It remains to be seen if Moro will get his wish. (Reporting by Eduardo Simoes; Editing by Kevin Liffey) Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
