The medical supplies to be donated to all 54 African nations via Ethiopia to fight COVID-19 coronavirus include 1.1 million testing kits, 6 million masks and 60,000 protective suits, says Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. On 20 March 2020, Ethiopia's national carrier Ethiopian Airlines suspended flights to 30 nations hardest-hit by coronavirus. Ethiopia has 9 confirmed cases in the country. EPA-EFE/STR “Considering the gravity of the #COVID19, the government of Ethiopia has enacted a State of Emergency,” Abiy’s office said. Africa’s second most populous nation at more than 110 million, Ethiopia has recorded 52 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and two deaths. Authorities have already taken a series of measures to stem the spread including closing schools, banning public gatherings and requiring most employees to work from home. The prime minister did not mention what additional steps would be taken under the state of emergency.
