(Photo: Tony Jackman)  Ingredients 6 to 8 rashers back bacon 3 large tomatoes, sliced 1 small onion, sliced thinly 1 Tbs cold water  Topping 200g plain flour 250g Cheddar cheese, grated (adjust quantity to your own taste) 2 heaped Tbs butter  Method Layer a greased baking dish with tomatoes, then bacon, then tomatoes, then a layer of sliced onions, and finish with a layer of bacon. Mix flour and butter with fingertips, then mix in the grated cheese. Sprinkle the water over the dish before adding the topping. Spoon the crumble evenly on top of the dish. Bake at 200C for approximately one hour.  TGIFood Tip A variation is to add a layer of sliced mushrooms. First fry them in butter until they release their own juices and then cook those juices away. Season with salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. DM Our Thank God It’s Food newsletter is sent to subscribers every Friday at 6pm, and published on the TGIFood platform on Daily Maverick.
