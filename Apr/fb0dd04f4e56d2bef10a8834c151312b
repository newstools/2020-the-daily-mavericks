Rosemary & Parmesan biscuits. Photo: Tony Jackman Ingredients 100g plain white flour 100g soft butter 100g very finely grated Parmesan cheese or similar such as Grana Padano 1 Tbs finely chopped rosemary leaves (see alternatives below)  Method Line a baking sheet with baking pepper. Give it a spritz of cooking spray. Combine flour and butter in a bowl and rub with your hands until it can be patted into a smooth ball. Knead on a lightly floured board and form into a ball again. Rap in cling film and refrigerate for an hour. Preheat oven to 190℃. Lay a sheet of baking paper on a wooden board and place the dough on it. Cover with a second sheet of baking paper and roll carefully until the dough is about a half centimetre thick. Use a cutter to shape rounds and lay out on the covered baking tray. Bake for 8 minutes. Remove to cool down a little, then lift carefully onto a wire rack using a slim spatula or knife. There will be enough for a second round – the batch we made turned out 24 biscuits. TGIFood Tip 1: Substitute any of the following for rosemary, in the same quantity: oregano leaves, thyme leaves, toasted sesame seeds. If using either of the herb leaves, chop them very finely first. TGIFood Tip 2: Salt lightly only if not using Parmesan.
