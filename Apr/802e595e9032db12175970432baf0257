 Ingredients 250ml cake flour
250ml sugar
2 tsp baking powder
pinch of salt
3 Tsp (tablespoons) cocoa
125ml oil
2 large eggs
1 tsp Vanilla essence
250ml hot water Method Combine all in a bowl and mix well.
Place in a well greased ice cream carton or similar bakkie.
Microwave on the highest setting for 7 minutes then switch off and leave for another 5 to 10 minutes to “settle” in the closed microwave (which is not running).
Tip:
Place a piece of paper towel under the mixture in the bakkie before microwaving – it helps with removing the cake when done.
