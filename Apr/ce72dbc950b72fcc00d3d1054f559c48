As residents continue life under lockdown in Port Elizabeth, Maverick Citizen photographer Mike Holmes captured moments of small routines, big gestures and glimmers of hope in a series of images examining life away from the quiet streets of the city. Holmes took his camera from the busy site of a food parcel handover, to the swimming pool where a youngster trains for a long-distance swim, to the quiet streets of a low-cost housing scheme where only a bull is roaming around.
