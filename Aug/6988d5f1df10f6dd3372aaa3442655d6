Much has been written about the world’s renewed enthusiasm for cooking and baking – especially sourdough bread – as countries around the globe went into lockdown. From thinking differently about what we eat, or learning more about the vulnerability of global food chains in times of lockdown, to learning new recipes, food can be as tasteful, yummy and exciting as it is political. This week, we dive into shows that talk about how cuisine is tied to national identity in the Middle East; linked to forced removals during apartheid, and tangled with immigrant experiences in the US. Listen in and be prepared to think differently about what’s on your plate. *** The Delicious Gatsby History, Identity and Politics – The Eusebius McKaiser Show (Radio 702) Length: 49 minutes

That’s Richard’s Famous Food Podcast, a dizzying, hilarious and irreverent look at food culture, starting with the recent bone broth fad. Voicing most of the characters and creating much of the elaborate sound design with his own vocal cords, Richard Parks III pokes fun at food crazes and snobbery.

Format: Single episode
Year: 2016
Listen on: Apple Podcasts, Stitcher or any other podcast app or streaming service The so-called Hummus Wars between Israel and Lebanon over who can lay claim to hummus as their national dish is at the centre of this fascinating story about food and politics. With their signature style of using the bare minimum of narration and maximising field recordings to create a sense of place rich with the texture of multiple voices, the Kitchen Sisters dig into how hummus became a symbol of competing national identities. The race to break the Guinness World Record for the largest tub of hummus brings into sharp relief the competing Jewish and Arab claims to the cultures and traditions of the Middle East. The genius of this story is how it uses a simple dish as a prism through which to view a very complex history. Bonus, if you visit the page for this episode, you’ll also find extra information, including Yotam Ottolenghi’s hummus recipe, yum! If you want to hear more of the Kitchen Sisters’ stories about food, you’re in luck. The creators of the show, Davia Nelson and Nikki Silva, have a whole series dedicated to the subject called Hidden Kitchens. A favourite is Kimchi Diplomacy, stories of how this Korean staple can bridge even the biggest divides. *** Cooking In An Immigrant Time Warp With Maangchi – The Sporkful (Stitcher) Length: 34 minutes
