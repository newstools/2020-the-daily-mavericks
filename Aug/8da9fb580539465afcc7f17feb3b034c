(Image: Adobestock) This week and next week will be the final columns in this series on security for pensioners. Both these columns give a summary of the previous columns and some extra information. The ghosts of the latest events are going to be long-lasting. Investment markets are going to be volatile. You can expect increases in taxes, you can expect inflation or deflation and you can expect less income in the years ahead. It is best to take action now. Here are the rules you should consider if you are already short of income or suspect you will be: Enhanced annuities pay out when: You may even qualify for an enhanced annuity if you are in fantastic health, but your partner (in a joint and survivorship annuity) suffers from a severe disease, smokes, drinks and weighs a lot. Your investment is seldom in the quoted index but is covered by a variety of different, and often complicated structures, under-written by a third party, creating what is called counter-party risk. Some of the problems include: dividends not being added into returns; there are cut-offs in the growth of the investments and often limits on the downside as well; costs are very seldom disclosed and they come off in many secretive ways; you are told that a third party risk (a bank or financing house) is underwriting the investments, but you are not aware of the contract between the issuer and the bank; and currency difference on foreign investments may or may not be included. Bruce Cameron, the semi-retired founding editor of Personal Finance of Independent Newspapers, over a number of weeks will look at the state of pensioners and retirement funds, which will highlight research undertaken by Alexander Forbes on retirement income in South Africa. Cameron is co-author of the best-selling book,Â The Ultimate Guide to Retirement in South Africa. Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
