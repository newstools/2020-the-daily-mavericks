Cyber attacks aren’t common in New Zealand but in neighboring Australia there has been an increase in incidents. In June, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned that the frequency of attacks on government, health and education services and various industries has been climbing over many months, and said organizations needed to improve their cyber resilience. On Tuesday, NZX said trading was disrupted by a “volumetric distributed denial of service attack from offshore” — an attempt to disrupt service by saturating a network with significant volumes of internet traffic. It had been able to mitigate the issue and the market began as normal at 10 a.m. today before prices and index updates were again halted. The S&P/NZX-50 benchmark index was near a record high when today’s incident occurred. It was at 11,987 at 3:13 p.m., little changed from Tuesday’s close. There is no indication yet as to who might have mounted the attack. “NZX’s network provider continues to investigate the source of the issue. We will provide further information once available,” NZX said. Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment. Sign up here or sign in if you are already an Insider.
