The EFF posted: “The Economic Freedom Fighters marks the 8th Anniversary of the Marikana Massacre. On this day 34 miners were brutally murdered by an ANC-regime in defence of the mining industry and white-monopoly capital. In a perverted collusion between the state and Lonmin, a conspiracy to characterise workers demanding a living-wage as criminals was devised, and the sitting Deputy President of the time and Non-Executive Director of Lonmin, Cyril Ramaphosa called for concomitant action to be taken against workers.” The SABC News Twitter account said: “Eight years after the Marikana shooting, President Cyril Ramaphosa is yet to visit the area as promised.” Foreign editor for the SABC, Sophie Mokoena posted: “My last comment  on Marikana.
