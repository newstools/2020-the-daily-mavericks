Earlier this month, the Federal government of Nigeria announced the re-opening of schools for exiting students in their final year to enable them write WAEC examination, after a five-month school closure to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease. EPA-EFE/AKINTUNDE AKINLEYE Lagos, the epicentre of the pandemic in Nigeria, plans to reopen colleges on Sept. 14, and primary and secondary school schools on Sept. 21, Babajide Sanwo-Olu said. “The gradual easing doesn’t mean the pandemic is over,” he said in a tweet. “It is not an invitation to carelessness or nonchalance.” The Lagos governor said restaurants, social clubs and recreational centers would also be allowed to reopen as long as they followed safety rules. Nigeria has reported 53,727 infections in total – including 18,104 in Lagos – and 1,011 deaths. The West African nation has been opening up gradually. It aims to resume international flights in September after domestic flights restarted last month and a ban on interstate travel was lifted. Secondary schools reopened across Nigeria this month for pupils due to take graduation exams.
