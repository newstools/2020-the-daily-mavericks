On Saturday, a rocket fell inside Baghdadâ€™s heavily fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign missions, while three others landed there on Thursday. Those attacks also caused no casualties. Washington blames such attacks on Iranian-backed militia groups. Iran has not directly commented on the incidents. Iraq, often the scene of spillover violence from U.S.-Iran tensions, seeks to avoid being drawn into any regional conflagration. The Middle East came close to a large conflict in January after a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi paramilitary chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis at Baghdad airport. Iran-aligned militias have sworn to avenge their deaths. (Reporting by Ahmed Aboulenein; Editing by Pravin Char) Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
