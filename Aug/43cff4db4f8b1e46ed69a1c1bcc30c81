The uproar over events in Zimbabwe continued to drive high volume conversation on South African social media. Twitter users took their campaign to the world stage by involving international celebrities. Zimbabwean Lives Matter @Zoe_Flood explained to Twitter users why #ZimbabweanLivesMatter was trending around the world, citing the arrests of protesters and journalists. Her post was retweeted more than 2,000 times and it received more than 2,600 likes by Wednesday morning. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa posted: “This morning I updated the people of Zimbabwe on the situation in our country. Despite the hurdles we face – cyclones, droughts, sanctions & now the Coronavirus – our goal remains constant: To reform, restructure & rebuild in order to improve the lives of our people.”  (900 retweets and 1,600 likes.) Twitter users were quick to join the conversation. Mmusi Maimane commented: “Hai man. This thing is simple, you must release investigative journalists like Hopewell Chin’ono, you must respect the rights of citizens to free speech and the rights of activists to organise around their causes.” (3,600 likes.) As awareness around the #ZimbabweanLivesMatter campaign grew, Twitter users became more critical of leadership in Zimbabwe and other African countries. @Ugaman01 tweeted a video of armed soldiers who appear to be kicking a man lying on the floor. As the video comes to an end, the Zimbabwean flag is shown along with the words, “We Can’t Breathe,” echoing a chant that became popularised during the Black Lives Matter protests in the USA. The video has been viewed close to 19,000 times and has received more than 1,100 likes. At 16:43 @ElsaAngel19 tweeted: “I don’t understand why African leaders feel the need to gain extreme power and money at anyone’s and everyone’s expense. Like you’d rather buy your fifth Mercedes than let people eat?”  The post received more than 5,400 likes. @justicemalala tweeted images of Jacob Zuma, Thabo Mbeki and Cyril Ramaphosa pictured with Emmerson Mnangagwa: “South Africa will not condemn the repressive Zimbabwe regime. Zimbabwe has tortured and killed thousands over the years and our leaders have supported the regime.  To them the only black lives that matter are those of the elite.”  His post has been retweeted more than 1,000 times. A diverse group of South African politicians, artists and academics took to Twitter to show their solidarity with Zimbabwean citizens. EFF commissar Mbuyiseni Ndlozi shared a post about the unjust and violent political regime: “We stand in Solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe.

Human Rights violation against our fellow African brothers and sisters is a crime against humanity. Period! 🇿🇼 We love you dearly and you’re in our prayers 🙏🏾❤️,” received 4,600 likes and 1,700 retweets. Following a recent trend, Mmusi Maimaine (@MmusiMaimane) tagged international actress Lupita Nyongo: “Hi @Lupita_Nyongo can you help us bring global attention to the human rights abuses in Africa. The attacks on black lives which need urgent global solidarity. A burning topic right now is the arrests of journalists and activists in Zimbabwe. #ZimbabweanLivesMatter.”  The tweet received over 8,600 likes and 3,700 retweets.

Spread the word Flag of Zimbabwe #ZimbabweLivesMatter #ZimbabweanslivesMatter.” Flint Bedrock shared a tweet with a video showing soldiers violently hitting civilians.
