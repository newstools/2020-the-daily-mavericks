Farmhouse braai bread. (Photo: Tony Jackman)  Ingredients 500 g brown bread wheat flour 1 cup/250 ml self-raising flour 20 g dry yeast 1 cup (250 ml) oats 60 ml treacle (or caramel) sugar 60 ml maple syrup (or golden) 30 ml canola oil 3 Tbs sesame seeds 15 ml salt 700 ml lukewarm water Olive oil for brushing the top Method Oil a heavy cast iron pot. Pour the brown bread flour into a large bowl and sift in the self-raising flour. Add the oats, sesame seeds, treacle sugar, maple syrup, salt, canola oil and yeast. Add the lukewarm water a little at a time. The result should be a slightly sticky but firm consistency. Knead until you have a firm dough, about 10 minutes. If too sticky while kneading, add a little more flour. Work it into a ball and leave it in the bowl, covered with a cloth, in a warm place for 30 minutes. Turn the oven on to a very low heat. Punch it and knead it for several minutes, folding and kneading, then cover with a damp cloth again. Turn off the oven. Place the bowl in the slightly warm oven to prove for half an hour. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil. Slide the dough into the greased cast iron pot, put the lid on, place coals around the base and a few on the lid, and cook for an hour. Replenish coals now and then. If there’s a fire nearby, turn the pot now and then to minimise burning on the sides.
