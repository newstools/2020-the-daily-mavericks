These two deaths occurred in the Western Cape; one at a private hospital and the other at a public hospital,” Mkhize said. He added that the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases has now surpassed 1,000 as overnight results became available. On Thursday night the number of cases was at 927. Gauteng has 409 confirmed cases, the Western Cape 229 including the two patients who died, KwaZulu-Natal 134, the Free State 49, North West 5, Mpumalanga 9, Limpopo 6, the Eastern Cape 5 and the Northern Cape 2. Mkhize said 79 cases were not allocated to a province. The announcement came hours into the start of the first day that South Africans are spending in lockdown. The lockdown was announced after President Cyril Ramaphosa declared the Covid-19 outbreak in the country a National State of Disaster earlier in March 2020. South Africans have been ordered to stay at home and the army was deployed to assist the police in enforcing lockdown regulations. DM Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
