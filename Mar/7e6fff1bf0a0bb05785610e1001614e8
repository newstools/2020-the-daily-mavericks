The Proteas women’s national team achieved this goal when they made it three wins out of three by beat Pakistan by 17 runs in Sydney on Friday. They now have the chance to make it four out of four when they play their final Pool B match against the West Indies in Sydney on Tuesday. A fourth victory would guarantee them top spot in a pool which includes two former winners in England and the West Indies. “Congratulations to our captain, Dane van Niekerk, head coach Hilton Moreeng and all the players and support staff on their unbeaten run to date,” commented CSA acting chief executive, Jacques Faul. “It has been impressive the number of different players who have come up with the match-winning performance when it was needed. Not to forget the players who have achieved personal landmarks! “We have had Mignon du Preez becoming the first South African, either male or female, to make 100 T20 International appearances followed by Lizelle Lee’s maiden T20 International century and the team posting the highest total in the Women’s T20 World Cup against Thailand and also the highest winning margin. “Let us also not forget their beating England for the first time in an ICC women’s tournament in either of the white ball formats. “The team is clearly in very good space heading into what is going to be the biggest week in the history of women’s cricket in South Africa. “It will be wonderful if they can lead our nation in celebrating International Women’s Day by being in the final next Sunday,” concluded Faul. – Sport24  Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
