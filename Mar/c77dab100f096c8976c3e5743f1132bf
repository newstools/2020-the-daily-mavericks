It is pointless if you simply Google everything. And, anyhow, key parts of it are deliberately unGoogleable (I think I have invented a new word there) or as unGoogleable as I could make them. The idea is to take your time and work together with your lockdown partners (if you have them) over several days. Maybe go old school and print it out. The structure is loosely based on a similar quiz in The Economist last December. Here’s how it works. There are 10 sets of five questions. The answers to each set of questions form a common theme or Missing Link. Some of those Missing Links are straightforward, some are more obscure (Sets One, Three, Six and 10 for example). One trick is that, if you have three or four answers, you might be able to spot the Missing Link which will then give you a clue about the question/s you haven’t yet answered. There are no prizes, simply the inestimable rewards of brain exercise. Answers will be posted on DM on Tuesday.
