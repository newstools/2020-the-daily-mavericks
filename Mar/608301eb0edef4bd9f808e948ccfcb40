She was only briefly in contact with the doctor, said Helge Braun, her chief of staff. “Given that, we are optimistic that the chancellor is perhaps not infected at all,” Braun told a talk show on ARD television late on Sunday. Merkel, 65, will continue her work from home and will be tested repeatedly over the next few days, her spokesman said on Sunday, adding it was too soon for a conclusive test yet. Merkel has said she will not seek a fifth term as chancellor in federal elections due by October 2021. She has loomed large on the European stage since 2005, helping guide the EU through the euro zone crisis and opening Germany’s doors to migrants fleeing war in the Middle East in 2015, a move that still divides the bloc and her country.
