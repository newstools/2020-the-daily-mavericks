In this regard, the minister was reinforcing the message from President Cyril Ramaphosa that we need a whole-of-society approach in order to achieve our developmental goals. Ramaphosa emphasised in the recent State of the Nation Address that government cannot solve societal challenges on its own: “It is through partnership and cooperation that we progress.” The president has asked South Africans to work more collaboratively and to do development differently. This is not a new call. It’s not the first time we are talking about partnerships and collaboration. Concepts like “cooperative governance” and “integrated development planning” have been around for a long time. Why have these approaches not always produced positive results? Based on an evaluation of 20 years of partnering practice in South Africa – what works and what doesn’t – here are 10 steps towards a new partnering approach which, in our experience, results in more successful implementation of public policy objectives:  Andrew Boraine is CEO of the Western Cape Economic Development Partnership (EDP), a not-for-profit company that helps the public sector and partners from business, civil society, and science and research work together to find practical solutions to complex problems.
