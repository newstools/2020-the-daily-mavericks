Algeria is hosting the second PANAF at the request of the African Union, 40 years after the north African country staged the first such event, when several nations were still struggling for independence. More than 8,000 artists and writers from all over Africa, as well as Brazil and the United States, are descending on Algeria for a huge cultural festival to take part in the event until 20 July. EPA/MOHAMED MESSARA “It is with deep sadness that we announce the loss of Manu Dibango, our Papy Groove, who passed away on 24th of March 2020, at 86 years old, further to covid 19,” it said.
