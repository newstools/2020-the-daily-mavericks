He is in self-quarantine at home and will continue working. Meanwhile, Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe was discharged from hospital on Sunday. He tested positive for Covid-19 on 14 July and was admitted to hospital six days later “for further medical attention and monitoring”. The Congress of South African Students has vowed to shut down all private schools on Monday. It has been against the closure of schools and argues now that poor learners will be left behind as their wealthier peers carry on with learning. Cyclist Nic Dlamini will be taking part in the first post-lockdown race since the season was suspended in March. He will tackle the Vuelta a Burgos in Spain on Tuesday, 28 July, 10 months since he last raced due to an injury and restrictions triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. As Craig Ray writes, Dlamini is “excited and nervous” to be back in the saddle – but he’s ready for it. DM/MC Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
