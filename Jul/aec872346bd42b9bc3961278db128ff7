Obies Oxtail Potjie, from foodSTUFF by Tony Jackman (Human & Rousseau). Photo by Myburgh du Plessis, styled by Sarah Dahl Ingredients 2 Tbs butter 1 large onion, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, crushed 2 carrots, finely diced 2 sticks celery, finely sliced 1 heaped tsp cornflour 1 cup (250 ml) dry red wine 100–200 ml Old Brown Sherry 1 cup (250 ml) cold water 1 tsp ground ginger leaves of 4–5 oregano sprigs 1 Tbs raspberry (or apple) jelly 1–2 stout oxtails Method Heat the potjie over hot coals if cooking on the braai, but have plenty of coals on the go so that you can add more over the course of 4 hours. Start in a similar fashion on the stove top if cooking in the kitchen. Melt the butter, and add the chopped onion, crushed garlic, diced carrots and sliced celery. Allow to simmer, stirring now and then, until the vegetables have softened. Sprinkle over a little cornflour, stir to coat, and cook for a minute or two, stirring. Add the red wine, sherry, water, ginger, oregano and jelly, stir well, and return to a gentle simmer. Add the oxtail chunks, bring back to a simmer, and cook on a gentle heat for 4 hours, preferably 6. Spoon off any extra fat.
