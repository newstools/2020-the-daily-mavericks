(Photo: Hein van Tonder @heinstirred) From Sophia Lindop’s new book, going home: Food and Stories from Lebanon, the Land of my Forefathers (Annake Müller Publishing) Ingredients (Serves 6) 1 cup olive oil 100 ml lemon juice, freshly squeezed zest of 1 lemon ½ cup calamata olives, pipped and sliced 2 tbsp fresh, roughly chopped rosemary salt and freshly ground black pepper to season 6 fish fillets (150–200 g each) Method Mix together all the ingredients, except for the fish, and allow to infuse for 2 hours before using. Wash the fish fillets and pat dry. Place in a dish and pour over the marinate, keeping some to one side to drizzle over just before serving. Leave the marinating fish in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. Remove from the refrigerator about 1 hour before cooking to bring to room temperature. When ready, heat a skillet until hot. Pour some of the marinade into the pan and add the fillets. Cook until just flaky and still moist. Serve on a platter and drizzle with the marinade that you kept aside. TGIFood tip: This marinade is quick and easy to prepare and can be stored in the refrigerator with success.
