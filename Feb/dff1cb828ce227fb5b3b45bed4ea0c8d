Over their long career they also worked with musicians Stevie Wonder and Dolly Parton, among others. Shabalala founded the prolific group in the small town of Ladysmith along the east coast of South Africa in the 1960s, at the height of white minority apartheid rule. According to the group’s website, the “Black” in their name was a reference to strong oxen and Shabalala’s early life on a farm, while the word “Mambazo” is the Zulu word for a chopping axe, a symbol of the group’s vocal power. Band manager Xolani Majozi told national broadcaster SABC that Shabalala had been ill since December when he was hospitalised. “We would like to extend our condolences on the passing of Joseph Shabalala who was the founder of the group Ladysmith Black Mambazo,” the government’s official twitter feed said.
