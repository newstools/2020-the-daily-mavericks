 The carrier will fly to Beijing and Shanghai once instead of twice a day from Tuesday to March 28, the company said on its website. Aeroflot also suspended some flights to the southern city of Guangzhou on Monday and to Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, starting from March 1, but still will keep flying four times a week to each city. All other major Russian airlines stopped flying to China on Jan. 31. (Reporting by Maria Tsvetkova; editing by Nick Macfie) Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
