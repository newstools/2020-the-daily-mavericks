Malaysia’s ministry of transport said it has not received any new credible evidence to initiate a new search. “However, the ministry will review any new evidence that it officially receives,” the ministry said in a brief statement. On Sunday, Australia’s News Corp reported that a new search could be mounted possibly this year, based on new evidence that it said showed the plane could have ended up in an area adjacent to the previous search area in the Indian Ocean. News Corp reported that U.S. exploration firm Ocean Infinity was in discussions with the Malaysian government to mount a new search on a no find no fee basis. Ocean Infinity did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Flight MH370 became one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries when it vanished on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. Malaysia, China, and Australia, called off a two-year, A$200 million ($130 million) underwater search in the southern Indian Ocean in January 2017 after finding no trace of the aircraft. A second three-month search, led by Ocean Infinity, ended similarly in May the following year.
