The changes set up an executive committee of 18 global chairs of investment banking who will focus on courting top clients. JPMorgan has been known to rotate managers among businesses to ensure successors stand ready whenever senior-most leaders retire, and elevating top performers can help avoid them being poached by competitors. Raghavan previously led the business in the European region and will remain CEO of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, while Casey ran the debt-underwriting unit. The moves come after the firm posted a record $7.58 billion in investment-banking fees in 2019, and a week before the bank’s annual investor day. In the past few years, JPMorgan has been hiring bankers in select geographies and sectors to boost coverage and market share. To contact the reporters on this story:
