I invite you to reflect upon the past decade in South Africa, how our independently regulated media was compromised, the mushrooming of completely unregulated “media”, and how these triangulated with massive armies of Twitter and Facebook bots, trolls and fake profiles, coupled with State Capture, Bell Pottinger “black/grey/white ops” and how these very same tactics continue to evolve in support of the State Capture gang (and some new allies) fighting back. And the so-called “narratives”. All too familiar. Think the old “Hawks Illegal Renditions”, the old “2nd IPID Report”, the old “Cato Manor hit-squad”, the ever-lasting “SARS rouge/rogue unit” propaganda, “fire pool” and that crap, and now the latest “Super Pravin of Canadian bank account fame is to blame for anything imaginable and more”, “CR money laundering”, blah, blah… oh, and all the “poison plots”. Note terminology, like: I wonder how many honest law-enforcement officers, good intelligence officers, genuine SARS officials, serious Zondo commission members, bona fide journalists and news editors have actually read this research, considered it within the South African context and their own daily lives, and are really ready and prepared for this? If not, mark my words, you’re a target and a goner. You will end up isolated, branded, overloaded, shunned, bullied and financially ruined, and don’t for one second believe your employer will pick up the legal tabs, even if you win every single time — they won’t. So to some Facebook followers involved in the media here: a) you need to read this and think it through, b) you need to be very aware of this, c) you need to raise this within our own country’s context now and do so publicly from your own respective platforms, and d) I’d be very interested in your comment to this. Be afraid. Be very afraid. DM First published on Facebook. Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment. Sign up here or sign in if you are already an Insider.
