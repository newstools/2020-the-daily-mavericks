Pepe was an illiterate person who, after the death of his wife in 2001, based his days and nights on trying to read and learn to write. She needed to express herself, to feel somehow close to her, to tell her that nothing had changed, that there are still corners in the house where her smell will remain eternal. To this day, he has written more than 500 poems that he is still reading through tears. Pepe is 87 years old and lives alone, although for health reasons, there are many days when his daughter comes to be with him and attend to their needs.
