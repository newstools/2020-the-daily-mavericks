Following a hearing on Thursday, Nichols gave the U.S. until 2:30 p.m. Friday to choose whether to agree to delay the Sunday night deadline or file court papers opposing ByteDance’s bid for the injunction. If the government doesn’t agree to postpone, the judge would hold a hearing on Sunday morning. Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Schwei argued against an expedited schedule in the case, saying ByteDance had filed a separate suit more than a month ago and was late in requesting the injunction. The case is TikTok Inc. v. Trump, 20-cv-2658, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
