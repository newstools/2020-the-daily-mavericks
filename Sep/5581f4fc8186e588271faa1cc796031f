Golden syrup and oats muffins. (Photo: Tony Jackman) Ingredients 2 ½ cups brown bread wheat flour ¾ cup treacle sugar (or similar such as caramel or muscovado sugar) ⅓ cup oats 2 heaped tsp baking powder ¼ tsp salt ¾ cup milk 2 extra large eggs ½ cup butter 90 ml golden syrup Extra treacle sugar and oats to sprinkle on top Method Preheat the oven to 200 ℃. Grease the cavities of a 6-muffin pan with butter and sprinkle flour over. Shake off excess flour. Mix the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and oats together in a bowl. Melt the butter and add the golden syrup, stirring until melted. In a separate bowl, beat together the eggs and milk. Pour both of these into the flour mixture and stir to combine. Spoon the mixture into 6 muffin cavities. Sprinkle treacle sugar on top and then scatter some oats. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes (mine were cooked in about 23 minutes). Eat immediately with butter and a little golden syrup.
