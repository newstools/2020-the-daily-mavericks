The measures include reduced opening hours for pubs and bars and extending the wearing of face masks on public transport and in shops to other public areas. Khan said he will be asking the government to implement the plan as soon as possible and would discuss it with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday. “Without adequate testing or contact tracing in London we have no choice but to look at other measures to slow the spread of the virus,” he said in a statement. “I firmly believe that acting early, rather than having to impose more stringent measures later, is the right thing to do both for public health and the economy.” He called on Johnson to invite him to the government’s emergency response meeting, a so-called COBR meeting, on Tuesday that is being attended by the leaders of the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Johnson will also address parliament on the coronavirus issue on Tuesday. (Reporting by James Davey, Editing by Paul Sandle) Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
