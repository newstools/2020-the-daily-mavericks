Diane Cassere’s chilli con carne. (Photo: Tony Jackman) Ingredients 700g lean beef mince 1 large onion 2 large green, red or yellow peppers (contrasting colours make for a good-looking dish) 3 large chillies 1 400 g can kidney beans 1 400 g can chopped tomatoes 2 large cloves garlic (or 2 tsp garlic salt) 2 Tbsns paprika 1 tsp salt 1 tsp black pepper 2 Tbsns olive or canola oil Method Chop the onion, chilies, peppers and garlic and place with the oil in a  heavy bottomed pot. Fry together with the paprika, salt and pepper. Slowly add the mince and brown. Add the beans and tomatoes. Mix together well, cover and place in a low oven for two hours to simmer and to let the flavours develop. The amount of chilli and paprika you add will determine the heat of the dish; more or less can be added to your own taste. The amount given here is for a medium heat. TGIFood Tip: Serve with a large dollop of cream cheese on every plate for a rich contrast to the chilli beef.
