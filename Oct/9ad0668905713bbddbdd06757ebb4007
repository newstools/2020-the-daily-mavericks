By Jason Lange With less than a week to go before next Tuesday’s election, a second Reuters/Ipsos poll showed that the two candidates remain neck and neck in Arizona. Reuters/Ipsos is polling likely voters in six states – Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona – that will play critical roles in deciding whether Trump wins a second term in office or if Biden ousts him. Below is a state-by-state look at Reuters/Ipsos findings, based on the online responses of likely voters: FLORIDA (Oct. 21 – Oct. 27) * Voting for Biden: 49% * Voting for Trump: 47% * A prior poll had showed Biden with an apparent lead of 50%-46%, with the margin being on the edge of the poll’s credibility interval. * 32% said they already had voted. * 48% said Biden would be better at handling the coronavirus pandemic. 42% said Trump would be better. * 52% said Trump would be better at managing the economy. 41% said Biden would be better. ARIZONA (Oct. 21 – Oct. 27): * Voting for Biden: 48% * Voting for Trump: 46% * The two are statistically tied as the margin is within the survey’s credibility interval. * A prior poll also showed a statistically even race, with 49% for Biden and 46% for Trump. * 37% said they already had voted. * 50% said Biden would be better at handling the coronavirus pandemic. 42% said Trump would be better. * 50% said Trump would be better at managing the economy. 44% said Biden would be better. MICHIGAN (Oct. 21 – Oct. 27): * Voting for Biden: 52% * Voting for Trump: 43% * Biden was up 51%-44% the prior week. * 32% said they already had voted. * 52% said Biden would be better at handling the coronavirus pandemic. 39% said Trump would be better. * 48% said Trump would be better at managing the economy. 45% said Biden would be better. NORTH CAROLINA (Oct. 21 – Oct. 27): * Voting for Biden: 49% * Voting for Trump: 48% * Since the margin is within the poll’s credibility interval, the race is statistically tied, as it was in the prior poll when Biden had 49% to Trump’s 46%. * 35% said they already had voted. * 48% said Biden would be better at handling the coronavirus pandemic. 44% said Trump would be better. * 51% said Trump would be better at managing the economy. 43% said Biden would be better. WISCONSIN (Oct. 20 – Oct. 26): * Voting for Biden: 53% * Voting for Trump: 44% * Biden’s advantage is marginally wider than his 51%-43% lead the prior week. * 33% said they already had voted. * 52% said Biden would be better at handling the coronavirus pandemic. 38% said Trump would be better. * 47% said Trump would be better at managing the economy. 45% said Biden would be better. PENNSYLVANIA (Oct. 20 – Oct. 26): * Voting for Biden: 50% * Voting for Trump: 45% * Biden’s lead is marginally wider than in the prior week when he was up 49%-45%, an advantage that was on the edge of the survey’s credibility interval. * 21% said they already had voted. * 50% said Biden would be better at handling the coronavirus pandemic. 42% said Trump would be better. * 50% said Trump would be better at managing the economy. 43% said Biden would be better.
