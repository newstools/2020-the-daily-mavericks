(Photo: Western Province Rugby) First published in Daily Maverick 168 Of those directors, the two who resigned this week were sponsors representatives – Hennie Heymans from DHL and Suzanne Stevens from Brightrock. Heymans’s parting shot was that he did not agree with the direction, nor the urgency, WPR was displaying in its talks with an American equity partner. Last month independent director Raymond van Niekerk resigned with similar misgivings about the business acumen of the hierarchy of the umbrella body, the Western Province Rugby Football Union (WPRFU). That came shortly after directors Andre van der Veen and chairman Johan van der Merwe were told their terms would not be renewed. In June, Kevin Kiewitz resigned from the board. Van der Veen was largely responsible for bringing the New York-based MVM to the table. The private equity group offered $6-million (R100-million) for a 51% stake in WPR. Despite the 45-day exclusivity period now over, the deal is still on the table. But WPR confirmed this week they are courting “other potential equity partners”, which does make it feel as if this was dragged out to ensure the exclusivity period expired. Sources have also told Daily Maverick that senior players are unhappy with the private-equity issue. Players are not keen to start contract renegotiations until there is clarity on the union’s financial future. There has even been talk of a strike if the hierarchy does not show their prized assets a solid future business plan. Investec sale scuppered In June, WPRFU president Zelt Marais declined to sign off on the sale of Newlands development rights to Investec, which had taken 18 months to finalise. Heads of agreement had been signed in December 2019 and Investec advanced the union R50-million to cover its debts that same month. But at the 11th hour Marais stepped back. Subsequently, he concluded a deal with Flyt Property Investment (previously AnySide). Flyt has investments in self-catering hospitality corporate suites. Only two directors are listed on the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission records – MD Zane de Decker, and Donavan van der Vyver. In an email to Daily Maverick on 30 June, Marais confirmed careful due diligence on the deal had been done, even though negotiations only started on 3 June. Flyt, through a subsidiary company called DreamWorld Investments, advanced the WPRFU a R112-million loan to cover its debt to Investec and R58-million owed to Remgro. WPRFU also signed over the mortgage bonds of 11 properties it owns to Flyt as guarantees for the loan. Yet this week news broke of the Flyt/WPRFU deal being in strife already. And bizarrely Marais admitted to a media conference on Wednesday that, in fact, due diligence had only sort-of been done. “When the deal was approved by the executive committee and the clubs there were ‘some things’ that had to be put into the long-form agreements,” Marais said this week. “So basically, the deal will be proceeded with [sic] when these conditions are all fulfilled … We sincerely hope it will be settled in the next two to three weeks.” Huh? We were told it was settled in June. If the deal breaks down now, the WPRFU has to pay back a R112-million loan to Flyt (Dream World) or risk having their 11 properties attached. So, to recap. Half a dozen directors have either been pushed out or quit. The property deal of the century could be on the ropes, leaving the WPRFU with huge debt and an unsold stadium, and most top Springbok players are eyeing the door. You wouldn’t know it from public utterances by new board chairman Ebrahim Rasool though. The silver-tongued former ambassador and full-time politician said with the sincerity of a holy man at the pulpit that reports of a union in crisis were unfounded. Listening to Rasool’s soliloquy about the “options”, “financial sustainability” and “stability” of the union was a lesson in the art of saying a lot without actually saying much. As has been the case for the entire year, the WP hierarchy has not only treated its fans with scorn, but its board and sponsors too. Fans are becoming disillusioned and sponsor relations are strained to breaking point. Yet the message from the WP president and chairman is, despite evidence to the contrary, there is nothing to worry about. There are challenges, but trust us. Everything’s fine.
