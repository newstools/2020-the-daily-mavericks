Miso chicken drumsticks. (Photo: Tony Jackman) Ingredients 6 plump chicken drumsticks 2 Tbsp miso paste 1 Tbsp sesame oil 1 Tbsp peanut oil 1 Tbsp mirin 1 Tbsp honey 2 tsp sambal oelek (or other chilli sauce) 1 Tbsp soy sauce 1 tsp salt Fresh coriander to garnish Method Combine all ingredients in a ziplock bag, massage the drumsticks through the bag, and marinate for 2 or 3 hours. Bake in a 220℃ oven for 35 to 45 minutes or until cooked through to the bone. Lower the temperature if they are overbrowning. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves. Keep the sides simple: a crisp green salad with a light Asian dressing would be perfect.
