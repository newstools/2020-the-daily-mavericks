Lemon curd. (Photo: Tony Jackman) This recipe accompanies this column on lemons Ingredients Zest of 1 lemon (about 1 Tbsp) ⅓ cup lemon juice (roughly the juice of 3 lemons) ⅔ cup white sugar 4 extra large egg yolks (reserve whites for a meringue or omelette) Pinch of salt 85 soft butter Method Zest 1 lemon first and set the zest aside, then squeeze the juice of 3 lemons into a bowl, strained through a fine sieve. Add to the bowl the zest, sugar, egg yolks, and salt. (Not the butter.) Have to hand the softened butter for whisking in after it’s cooked. Use a double boiler or, if you don’t have one, a metal bowl over a pot containing about 5 cm of water. Turn on the heat and, when it boils, reduce to a very low heat and place the bowl in it. Immediately start whisking, using a hand-held whisk (it’s worth the effort). Continue whisking for 9 to 10 minutes and the curd thickens. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter a bit at a time until all is incorporated. Spoon into a sterilised jar and cool to room temperature, then refrigerate. It will thicken considerably in the fridge. And your toast will be very happy.
