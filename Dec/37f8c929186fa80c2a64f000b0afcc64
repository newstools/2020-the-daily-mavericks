All Comments 1 A fascinating list of people who passed on this year. The first mentioned, Aimee Stephens is ‘related’ to the role of RBG mentioned later. This is in respect of the cynical appointment of Amy Coney Barrat by the collusion of the white supremacist Mc Connell (who swore and acted to limit Obama’s election as president of the US to one term… and failed). There is every possibility of her (Amy’s) rushed appointment (after the judgement in the Stephens case) to the supreme court, resulting in the reversal of the decision. That is … unless Amy’s very conservative Catholic views (even surpassing that of the Pope!), undergo a swift transformation.
