House on Fire, Swaziland, 2004 “In Portraits, Terre’Blanche seems to be pensively staring into the camera; Masekela is laughing, exuberant, the image filled with life. The photograph of the South African musician was taken in photographer Marc Shoul’s own flat; he remembers that moment as “magical”, adding, “I played a bit of guitar with him. It was just… Incredible. That night will remain one of the most memorable times.” But there are many more characters, famous and less famous, who posed in front of his lens, and Portraits is a collection of images he has gathered across cities, countries and cultures”, says Karel van der Vyver who interviewed the photographer about his work.
