Under South African law, what happened at Newlands nearly two years ago in the Smith and Warner ball-tampering sphere does fall into the criminal sphere, says the writer. (Photo: Adobestock) A Proteas player returned a positive Covid-19 test just hours before the first of three One-Day Internationals (ODIs) was due to start at Newlands. The test was conducted on Thursday. It means players in both camps, who are all staying at the same local hotel, will undergo more tests in the next 24 hours to ensure that Sunday’s match can go ahead. The full statement from Cricket South Africa (CSA) read: “Cricket South Africa (CSA) and the England Cricket Board (ECB) would like to announce the postponement of the first Betway One-Day International (ODI) of the three-match series to Sunday, 6 December 2020. “This decision results from a player from the Proteas team testing positive for Covid-19 after the teams’ last round of scheduled testing performed on Thursday ahead of the ODIs. “In the interests of the safety and well-being of both teams, match officials and all involved in the match, the acting CEO of  CSA, Kugandrie Govender as well as the CEO of the ECB, Tom Harrison, have agreed to postpone the first fixture to Sunday.” DM Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
