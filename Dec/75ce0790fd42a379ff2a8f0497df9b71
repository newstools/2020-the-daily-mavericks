Juergen Klopp’s side were outplayed by Scott Parker’s adventurous team before halftime at Craven Cottage and trailed to Bobby Decordova-Reid’s superb 25th-minute effort. They were more like themselves after the break and levelled in the 79th when Salah beat Alphonse Areola from the spot after a rather harsh handball decision. The visitors looked likely to go and grab the winner but Fulham held out for a well-deserved point to leave Liverpool level on 25 points with leaders Tottenham Hotspur. Fulham are fourth from bottom with eight points. (Reporting by Martyn Herman Editing by Toby Davis) Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
