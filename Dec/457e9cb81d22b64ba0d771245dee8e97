While 5G network deployment is still in its infancy, with 100 wireless carriers worldwide offering the service in limited areas, the preparation for 6G development is getting started in several regions around the world. In addition to Nokia-led Hexa-X in Europe, there’s Next G Alliance and O-RAN Alliance in the U.S. The Chinese government is also funding a 6G development group. 6G technology is expected to use super high-frequency terahertz airwaves and deliver advanced connectivity, which could even link up to technology in the human body and brain — as well as real-time holographic imaging — starting in 2030. Devaki Chandramouli is Nokia’s head of North American standardization and is one of the engineers leading 6G development with the Next G Alliance. She says she wants to establish three objectives initially. “The main goal will be to develop the vision, the road map and the timeline,” she said. “Then put together a timeline for the technology direction. And the third point is to facilitate the interaction with U.S. government agencies to fund the research and also provide the input for the technology development.” Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
