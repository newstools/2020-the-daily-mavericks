The deactivated semi-automatic Walther PP pistol, which along with its smaller model the PPK became one of the film franchise’s best-known images, was used by Connery in the movie “Dr. No” in 1962. Connery, the first James Bond in the franchise, died on Oct. 31 at the age of 90. Julien’s said the winning bidder, who asked to remain anonymous, was an American who had seen every James Bond movie with his or her children. The auction house had previously estimated that the gun would fetch between $150,000 and $200,000. A helmet created for Tom Cruise in “Top Gun” also sold at the auction for $108,000, while a sword used by Bruce Willis in “Pulp Fiction” fetched $35,200.
