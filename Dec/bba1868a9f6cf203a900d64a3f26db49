The southern African country generates less than half of its own electricity and relies on imports from South Africa and Mozambique for the rest. Local production has been hit by a drought that shuttered the nation’s main hydropower plant and by frequent breakdowns at its coal-fired Hwange facility. The government has gradually opened more of the struggling economy to foreign transactions since the start of a virus lockdown in March, backtracking on an earlier decision to make the Zimbabwe dollar the sole legal tender. Citizens can now use U.S. dollars for food shopping, fuel, toll fees and passports. The move has undermined demand for the Zimbabwe dollar, sending its value slumping and it now trades at 81.73 to the U.S. dollar. The utility said the exchange rate from a weekly foreign auction system would be used to settle consumers’ electricity bills. Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
