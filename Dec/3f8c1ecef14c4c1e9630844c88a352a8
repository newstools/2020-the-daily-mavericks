World Rugby deputy chairman Bernard Laporte defended the governing body on Monday. “We don’t know the contents (of the case). World Rugby has been doing a lot in terms of player welfare and safety,” he told reporters at the 2023 World Cup draw in Paris. “I was impressed with the work done on the health and safety of players when I joined World Rugby four years ago. “We are a model in terms of research, innovation and mastering this area.” The list of potential claims has grown significantly over the past few days and now stands at more than 100 players, according to the Daily Telegraph.
