“It’s safe to say that in the Garden Route, there is a second wave,” said head of the Western Cape’s health department, Dr Keith Cloete. Addressing a virtual media briefing on Thursday, he said the spike in cases along the Garden Route fits the description of second waves in other countries. Much of the briefing by Western Cape premier Alan Winde and his team of health experts, including Cloete, focused on the increase in Covid-19 cases in the Garden Route areas of George, Knysna and Plettenberg Bay. These areas were declared hotspots earlier in the week.

He said cases – as well as deaths and hospitalisations – were increasing in the province. There are currently 752 Covid-19 hospitalisations in the Western Cape, with 185 of those on the Garden Route. Winde urged people to downscale events during the holiday season. He said there was a “need to take lessons from other parts of the world”. Dr Terence Marshall, head of the Garden Route health cluster, said hospital admissions had “consistently increased in the last two weeks”. Marshall gave the following updates: On 17 November, there were new Covid-19 cases reported in the following Garden Route areas: During October and November, a spike in cases occurred in George, Knysna, Thembalethu (George), Plettenberg Bay and Pacaltsdorp (George), said Marshall. Cases were also starting to increase in the Mossel Bay area. Some areas were spiking because of social gatherings like parties and sports events. Winde said economic activity needed to continue in this popular tourist area during the festive season, but that “it needs to be safe”. Cloete said talks would be held with organisers of large gatherings such as Matric Rage in Plettenberg Bay. Health officials would be required to sign off on such events. This is not the first time the area has seen a spike in coronavirus cases. At the beginning of November, Winde called for extra vigilance after new infections were reported after the school holidays.
