Dorah Sitole’s way with a Rack of Lamb. (Photo: Roelene Prinsloo) Ingredients 10 baby potatoes 125 ml (½ cup) sunflower oil 1 x 6-bone rack of lamb 250 g cherry tomatoes 125 ml (½ cup) black olives, stoned 4 garlic cloves salt and freshly ground black pepper a few sprigs rosemary Method Preheat the oven to 190 °C. Boil the potatoes until tender. Heat half the oil in a frying pan and add the cooked potatoes. Crush the potatoes in the frying pan using a masher. Fry for 5 minutes over a low to medium heat. In another large frying pan, add the remaining oil. Sear the lamb until golden on both sides. Remove from the pan, set aside and keep warm. Stir the cherry tomatoes and olives into the potatoes with some seasoning and rosemary sprigs. Drizzle with a little oil and place in a roasting tin. Place the lamb on top of the potatoes and cook for 30-45 minutes or to your desired doneness. When cooked to your liking, slice the rack of lamb into chops and serve with the crispy potatoes and tomatoes. TGIFood Tip: Take the meat out of the fridge 30 minutes before it goes into the oven.
