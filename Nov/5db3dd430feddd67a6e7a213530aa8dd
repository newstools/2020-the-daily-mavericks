Ademola Lookman’s cool finish gave Fulham a 30th-minute lead and Ivan Cavaleiro’s penalty doubled it before halftime. Leicester, who could have joined Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool on 21 points, enjoyed lots of second-half possession but Fulham defended diligently and were a threat on the break. Harvey Barnes set up a tense finale with a thumping finish in the 86th minute to give Leicester hope of salvaging something from a disappointing performance. But Fulham just about held on for their second win of the season to climb to 17th place with seven points from 10 matches.
