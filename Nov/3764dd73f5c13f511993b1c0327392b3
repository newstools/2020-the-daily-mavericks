(Photo: Shaun Cozett) I am angry at the seeming powerlessness of our community to prevent this. I’m angry at the selfish financial interests who block change. I’m angry that these shootings happen at all. But I know that this anger is your anger. It’s the same anger Jesus felt when he overturned the tables in the Temple, angry that anyone would be taken advantage of in any way. Help me see in these emotions your own desire for change. Help me see in these feelings your moving me to act. Help me see in these reactions your pushing me to do something. Because I know this is the way you move people to action. And I know that you desire action. For Jesus did not stand by while people were being hurt. He plunged into their lives. So help me to answer these questions: How can I help? How can I fight against gun violence? How can I urge my political leaders to enact change? How can I help people understand that this is an issue about life? I am sad over the loss of life, tired of excuses for the loss of life, and angry that we are paralysed by the loss of life. So, turn my sadness into compassion. Turn my tiredness into advocacy. Turn my paralysis into the freedom to act. Help me to be compassionate, to advocate and to act, as your son did, Almighty God. DM James Martin is a US Jesuit priest.
