By Jason Lange A week earlier, Reuters/Ipsos polls showed Trump and Biden in a statistical tie across the three states. Reuters/Ipsos polled likely voters in six states – Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – that will play critical roles in deciding whether Trump wins a second term in office or if Biden ousts him. Below is a state-by-state look at Reuters/Ipsos findings, based on the online responses of likely voters: FLORIDA (Oct. 27 – Nov. 1) * Voting for Biden: 50% * Voting for Trump: 46% * A prior poll showed Biden leading Trump 49%-47%, effectively a tie because the margin was within the poll’s credibility interval. * 41% said they already had voted. * 47% said Biden would be better at handling the coronavirus pandemic. 44% said Trump would be better. * 53% said Trump would be better at managing the economy. 42% said Biden would be better. ARIZONA (Oct. 27 – Nov. 1): * Voting for Biden: 49% * Voting for Trump: 47% * The two are statistically tied as the margin is within the survey’s credibility interval. * A prior poll also showed a statistically even race, with 48% for Biden and 46% for Trump. * 49% said they already had voted. * 49% said Biden would be better at handling the coronavirus pandemic. 41% said Trump would be better. * 52% said Trump would be better at managing the economy. 42% said Biden would be better. NORTH CAROLINA (Oct. 27 – Nov. 1): * Voting for Biden: 49% * Voting for Trump: 48% * Since the margin is within the poll’s credibility interval, the race is statistically tied, as it was in the prior poll when Biden had 49% to Trump’s 48%. * 43% said they already had voted. * 49% said Biden would be better at handling the coronavirus pandemic. 43% said Trump would be better. * 51% said Trump would be better at managing the economy. 43% said Biden would be better. MICHIGAN (Oct. 27 – Nov. 1): * Voting for Biden: 52% * Voting for Trump: 42% * Biden was up 52%-43% the prior week. * 37% of adults said they already had voted. * 52% said Biden would be better at handling the coronavirus pandemic. 40% said Trump would be better. * 48% said Trump would be better at managing the economy. 44% said Biden would be better. WISCONSIN (Oct. 27 – Nov. 1): * Voting for Biden: 53% * Voting for Trump: 43% * Biden was up 53%-44% the prior week. * 41% of adults said they already had voted. * 52% said Biden would be better at handling the coronavirus pandemic. 38% said Trump would be better. * 47% said Trump would be better at managing the economy. 45% said Biden would be better. PENNSYLVANIA (Oct. 27 – Nov. 1): * Voting for Biden: 51% * Voting for Trump: 44% * Biden was up 50%-45% the prior week. * 25% of adults said they already had voted. * 51% said Biden would be better at handling the coronavirus pandemic. 40% said Trump would be better. * 48% said Trump would be better at managing the economy. 46% said Biden would be better.
