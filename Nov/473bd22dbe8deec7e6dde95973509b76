All Comments 2 A delicious and poignant combination of apt Attenborough commentary and 2lani cartoon, about a more serious global pandemic than Covid ! Unable to listen to this article. All I hear is ‘Life on planet Trump narrated by David Attenborough’ followed by silence. Unless the silence is significant, although Trump is so vocal that silence seems unlikely unless it represents the silence of a planet on which all life forms have been obliterated and silenced by Trump.
