The ANC has backtracked on its August anti-corruption decisions and says that it has not asked its secretary-general Ace Magashule to step aside and neither does it expect him to do so. Magashule faces various corruption and maladministration charges related to his terms as Free State premier and he is scheduled to make a first appearance in the Bloemfontein magistrates court on Friday, 13 November. “We did not discuss (him) stepping down. The issue of stepping down is a matter the NEC (national executive committee) is still seized with,” said the party’s treasurer-general Paul Mashatile. At a special anti-corruption NEC meeting in August, the party restated a 2015 resolution that “those accused of corruption and other serious crimes against the people, including those charged in courts, may be expected to step aside from their positions or responsibilities” and said corruption had made it …”collectively to dip our heads in shame and to humble ourselves before the people”. But Magashule has been given a hospital pass by the ANC even though he faces a raft of corruption charges related to the R255-million Free State asbestos audit. The deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte said that the NEC had put its “step-aside” decision on the back burner and would take “serious legal counsel” on it because in other cases, charges were withdrawn and court cases had become complicated. It is likely to discuss the step-aside resolution at its next NEC meeting.  There will be no special executive meeting to discuss the charges Magashule is facing. No posters, marches or protests at court Duarte said that Magashule did not want protests at court – “(there must be) no marches, no T-shirts and placards printed in his name” – and she revealed that “there were huge tensions brewing” in the ANC and especially in its Free State branches after Magashule’s arrest warrant was issued on 10 November. The ANC will not stop supporters going to court but they may not go in ANC gear (a ban that has been serially ignored by factions). Duarte said “We will not interfere with law enforcement processes. We expect that from all our members.” The ANC statement was betwixt and between, revealing how the charges have caused ructions in the ruling party: while it cannot force Magashule to step aside, Duarte and Mashatile repeatedly made statements against corruption. “We need to show our people that we take malfeasance seriously”; “No leader should support any act of corruption”; and “The judiciary is independent in accordance with our Constitution and we respect this.” Ekurhuleni mayor threatens civil unrest on Twitter Pinning the Magashule warrant to his page, Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina tweeted: “A moment for civil unrest is now, we can’t allow abuse of State institutions to further political ends. This is wrong, those elected must implement our resolutions and arrest white masters for us to believe they are genuine.”  He added a second tweet: “Arresting leadership based on apartheid does not make sense. I reject this arrest and will be in court with my SG to support him against this democratic disgrace.” Masina later deleted the tweets. The party’s head of crime and corruption working group, Tony Yengeni, also opposed the warrant and charges against Magashule. The ANC has also backtracked against its constitutional provision that ANC leaders facing serious charges should step aside or be suspended.  It says that: “Where a public representative, office-bearer or member has been indicted to appear in a court of law on any charge, the secretary-general… acting on the authority of the NEC… if satisfied that the temporary suspension of such (person) would be in the best interest of the Organisation, may suspend such public representative, office-bearer or member…” ANC members ignore Ramaphosa’s anti-corruption measures Magashule is part of a line of ANC leaders facing charges who have ignored President Cyril Ramaphosa’s seven-page letter to members in August promising a turning point against corruption. In it, he reiterated the step-aside rule but in KwaZulu-Natal, Mike Mabuyakhulu has returned to work; and at Parliament, ANC MP Bongani Bongo has refused to step down although he is party to a criminal case currently in court.

All Comments 31 No wonder we don’t believe a word the ANC say. Bunch of hypocrites No surprise. The ANC picked up that Soviet-era, autocrat (mis)logic that leadership’s behaviour does not influence the actions of rank-and-file, a bit like a negligent parent who thinks their offspring will follow their commands for the sake of it. The concept of a double-standard escapes them. But I think this is perhaps even more insidious and closer to the logic of people with no moral or ethical values. If the ANC actually allowed this to happen, it would soon have many of its leaders removed from positions. I’m sure that was top of Jessie Duarte’s mind, as a warrant for her cannot be too far off. When criminals make the rules, they will break them to survive. And the NEC is at least half-full of people who have stolen from the country without a shred of regret or conscience. Expecting them to keep their word is like, well, expecting a Free-State public sector contract to actually deliver. At least it means the NPA can divide and conquer. Keep going after the smaller leaders and watch those guys refuse to listen to the NEC. This double-standard will ultimately either destroy the ANC, or destroy the country as criminals in the ANC burn everything to save themselves. Oh what a surprise 😂. Did anyone expect anything different? Absolutely disgusting! Typical anc deceit – talk the talk (only under immense popular pressure, kicking and screaming, I might add) but never walk the walk. This government is nothing but a bunch of degenerate morons. Magashule is guilty as sin and everybody knows it. What a slap in the face of SA. What a pathetic bunch of so called leaders the ANC has turned out to be. From liberating hero’s to corrupt individuals, who are prepared to ruin the country’s economy and deprive to poor and destitute of the little they have. Completely expected – CR is getting weaker by the day! And so the long-fingered lily-livered feather-brained spineless ANC spongebobs blindsides justice. But what did we expect with a Corruption Committee chaired by convicted criminal Tony Yengeni? What on earth did anyone expect? This is the ANC – an organised crime syndicate, masquerading as a political party. If the case ever gets to Court Ace will get off, just like they all do. What ever happened to his threats to sue Pieter Louis-Myburgh who first blew the whistle on this. Ace took no action because it was ALL TRUE! And if he is denied bail; what then? Is there anyone in the ANC who is not bent ….? Perhaps its time for ratepayers and Businesses in Ekurhuleni to relocate to areas where they are welcome and have a mayor who understands economics. So the presidents line in the sand message were just empty words. Does he think any thinking citizen will ever believe him again? What a mad week. A defeated US President refusing to stand down, a EFF rally protesting at a school because some matriculants (severely under stress because their school year was compromised due to Covid-19) was celebrating at a private party, and now, the governing party refusing to ask one of their political party leaders to step down following a formal charge of corruption by the NPA. So what is worse, of the three events? Well, all three are running the mile in a record SLOW time. The ANC is a mess, American politics is a mess, and the whole issue of whom is actually racist in South Africa is a mess. Even journalists are “lost for words”, with many contradicting each other across media spectrum. So who do we believe? Toss the coin! Why would he? The precedent not to was established long, long ago. We read that the NEC is “still seized with ” the matter (read: serious seizure) and then “The party’s head of crime and corruption working group, Tony Yengeni, also opposed the warrant and charges against Magashule”. Down the rabbit hole we go. Just help me with this, for every job candidate there are several minimum requirements and standards, such as qualifications, experience, necessary skills, clean criminal record. Then candidates must be interviewed by a panel, background checks are done, referrals must be obtained and qualifications are validated, etc. What are the minimum requirements to become a politician in SA, and in fact the rest of the world? Seems to me there are no standards or minimum requirements, no referrals, no background checks, no interviews, no nothing, to be in these positions, no wonder corruption and misadministration and, and, and are rife!
This is just crazy, we trust these people with our lives…… Strange that as soon as people are held to account for their actions, out comes the race card – pathetic! On the one hand the Duarte tells us “We need to show our people that we take malfeasance seriously”. On the other Toni Yengeni is the head of crime and corruption working group. For some reason I don’t think the ANC gives a tinker’s cuss about this country. As if it is required …this proves that political parties, especially those wielding the most power, have no interest in the accountability of their leadership. All the spin about cleaning up corruption is nothing but a PR exercise aimed at their gullible supporters! This dilemma (not to be confused with Malema!) even faces the judiciary in some cases. Is it any wonder that many young people, in particular, are ‘turned off’ politics? The ANC is not a political party any longer. It’s a criminal conspiracy. The ANC is so “seized” with the issue that it has suffered an epileptic seizure. What a charade. Have to admire their brazenness. The ANC is corrupt beyond redemption. Every time I see this midget, called Jessie Duarte, I think of another Jessie, namely Jessie James. Who off course was a famous villian/hero in the old wild west of the USA. Jessie Duarte is neither, not a villian, not a hero. What the hell is a deputy? it means you basically less important. And with respect, she sounds like that. How can anybody in the ANC defend a criminal of the statute of this Ace guy, a key component in the State Capture saga What is so amazing is that there are people out there who actually thought that Ramaphosa’s forked-tongued assurances would herald a new dawn of honest government in SA. And many of these people have lived in Africa their whole lives! We deserve the government we vote for. Sadly race is the only issue at stake in our politics and we will all be damned because of it. We have supposedly serious journalists who seem to have no qualms about the DA electing a black leader, ANY black leader, provided its black because this is the only chance the party has of becoming relevant. Maybe Ace would be interested, after all he’s black and a seasoned politician. #voetsekANC Why am I not surprised? After all, the average jellyfish has more backbone than the entire NEC. The Top Six doesn’t even come close. “The party’s head of crime and corruption working group, Tony Yengeni…” I think THAT sentence pretty much sums the ANC and its ‘willingness’ to actually get rid of those guilty of corruption! Can one believe anything Ramaphosa says, after this? He has become a puppet of the criminal ANC network. Unfortunately, there is 30 million odd uneducated voters out there voting for for him, and his extensive corruption network. South Africas must now ne ranked as the most corrupt country in the world What else would we expect? Does the leopard change its spots? So why should we expect the ANC , when crunch time comes , to take positive,ethical action against its erring comrades,especially those at the top? Talk has always been cheap and so always utterly useless unless carried through into action. A lot of people very upset about this. Question is, what are we going to do about? Or what are we willing to do about? There are two flies on the wall I want to be: Trump’s meetings this week. The anc big six meetings this week. The anc needs to realize that a great many ordinary decent South Africans will soon vote and they dislike Ace about as much as Trump loves Harris. R255m of tax payers money looted under his watch but “I have done nothing wrong” and “the struggle continues..”.
No conscience, no morals, no remorse, no justice , no decency.
Just pathetic ANC.
