The diagnosis from his personal physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, came after Biden received X-rays and a CT scan Sunday evening near his home in Wilmington, Delaware. The injury happened Saturday while Biden was spending the holiday weekend with his family in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where they have a vacation home. Biden’s transition team issued a statement earlier Sunday afternoon saying he would see an orthopedist on Sunday “out of an abundance of caution.” After X-rays at a Newark, Delaware, orthopedic medicine practice, his doctor said Biden sprained his foot and had no apparent fracture. But a follow-up scan at another medical office showed small fractures in the lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones in his mid-foot. Biden, 78, is set to be become the 46th president on Jan. 20. The Bidens have two German Shepherds, Champ and Major, and told CBS News they also plan to bring a cat with them when they move into the White House. Major was adopted by the Bidens from the Delaware Humane Association in 2018 and is set to become the first shelter dog to live with the first family.
