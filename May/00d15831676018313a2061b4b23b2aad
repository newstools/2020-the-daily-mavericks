Judge Hans Fabricius ruled that the SANDF, SAPS and JMPD officers who were present when Collins Khosa was allegedly tortured and killed in Alexandra in April must be suspended. In addition, authorities need to complete their investigations into his alleged killing by 4 June. The judge instructed authorities to issue and widely share a new code of conduct to guide lockdown operations. They need to publicly state their commitment to upholding the right to life, the right to dignity and the right not to be subjected to torture or unusual punishment. The government was also ordered to publish general social distancing guidelines and explain how they will be enforced. Judge Fabricius said government leaders, such as Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and Police Minister Bheki Cele, had not clearly condemned abuse by security forces. As Greg Nicolson reports, Fabricius agreed with Khosa’s family “that there is no existing mechanism capable of conducting prompt, impartial and effective investigations of lockdown brutality” and ordered the government to establish a new reporting mechanism for the lockdown.

The Eastern Cape Department of Health says it has improved its system of managing personal protective equipment in public hospitals since the Minister of Health, Zweli Mkhize, visited the province recently. The superintendent-general of the department, Dr Thobile Mbengashe, admitted that Mkhize pointed out “that we were not really doing our job well”. Since then, the department has started an internal audit of stock, promoted the “rational use of PPE” and aims to keep up a minimum of four weeks’ supply of essential PPE. As Estelle Ellis writes, orders for more stock have been placed. Mkhize said he is satisfied with the improvements.

At least 30 Covid-19 survivors in South Africa are donating their blood in the hope that it can be used to help those who have mild or severe forms of Covid-19. A large clinical trial will be launched in June to see if their plasma, once separated from the blood, can help patients by providing them with antibodies through transfusion. The trial seeks to understand whether or not the immune system of Covid-19 patients can be boosted through such transfusions. “These donors, our unsung heroes, will add to the information and science we need now to save lives. People are scared and fake news is adding to the fear. These survivors want to help,” says Marion Vermeulen, a biomedical scientist from South Africa’s National Blood Service who is leading the trial.
