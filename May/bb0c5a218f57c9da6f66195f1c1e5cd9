Gem Squash and Saffron Soup with Parmesan. (Photo: Louis Pieterse)  Ingredients 8 plump gem squash 4 Tbs Butter 2 medium onions, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, smashed 1.2 litres veg stock 100ml cream Generous pinch of saffron 2 Tbs grated or shaved Parmesan per portion 150g finely grated Parmesan Salt and pepper to taste Method Melt butter in a big, heavy-bottomed pot. Add the onions and garlic and sauté gently on a low heat heat five minutes, stirring now and then. Peel and chop the gem squash, remove the seeds and add. Add the vegetable stock. Bring to a boil and then reduce to simmer for 20 to 25 minutes or until the squash is soft. Cool a little and blend until smooth. Return to the stove, pour in the cream and add the salt, pepper (go carefully, it must not overpower the saffron) and saffron. Bring to a simmer and cook gently for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure it doesn’t catch at the bottom. Taste and adjust seasoning of you like – that includes the saffron. If too subtle, add a little more and let it simmer to take up the flavour. Finally, stir in the finely grated Parmesan. Serve with grated or shavings of Parmesan on top and a deft sprinkling of saffron.
