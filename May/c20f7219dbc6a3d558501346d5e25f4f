Add onion, half of the cheese and the mustard, garlic and seasoning. Mix well. Separate the eggs and beat the yolks into the potato mixture. Whisk the whites until stiff and fold into the potato mixture. Place in a greased ovenproof dish, sprinkle with the remainder of the cheese and bake at 180C for one hour. TGIFoodTip: Add a little cream to the mix instead of some of the water or milk used in the instant potato packet instructions. You can also fry the onions in a little butter or oil first for extra flavour and depth. Serve with a fresh tomato and basil salad.
