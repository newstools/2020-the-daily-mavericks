This emerged during a portfolio committee meeting that was attended by the department’s oversight committee, Minister Nathi Mthethwa and the department’s Director General, Vusimuzi Mkhize on Wednesday afternoon. The presentation to the committee, led by Mkhize, stated that the application process had seen the department receiving 470 total applications from the sporting fraternity. As of 20 May 2020, 297 had been approved – with 282 of those being paid. Mkhize said that those whose applications were unsuccessful were “informed, and they’ve also been informed of a process to appeal”. Mkhize added that an appeals panel had been put in place to oversee the process and that those wishing to appeal have five days from the day on which they received a rejection email to appeal. The department explained to the committee that so far 173 of the applicants had been rejected for not meeting the criteria or submitting applications which were incomplete. However, they did acknowledge that the short turnaround had affected the quality of the applications. At the end of March 2020, the department announced a relief fund to the tune of R150-million, which those in the sports and arts sectors could apply for and share. However, the department’s criteria was very strict: “Only athletes who were confirmed to participate at events that have now been cancelled or postponed due to Covid-19 and whose income is generated solely through specific sporting events,” could apply. There had been a general outcry that the turnaround time for applications was very short, even with the department adding two more days to the initial deadline of 4 April 2020. A number of members of the committee brought up how the quickened process might also have been unfair, particularly on athletes who were on lockdown in rural areas and had no access to the internet or to digital platforms – and thus could not compile the required documentation timeously. “The period they were given was not a lengthy period because of time. There were gaps in application. Hence, we’re giving them a second chance,” said Mthethwa in response, while also hinting that there would be another opportunity to apply over and above the appeals process. A member of the committee, Tsepo Mhlongo, called on sports federations to come out and corroborate the information that the department has in relation to beneficiaries of the relief fund. This suggestion was supported by another committee member, Mbulelo Bara. “Those who are supposed to benefit must benefit. Because there is nowhere else where they will get something until we defeat this pandemic,” said Bara.
