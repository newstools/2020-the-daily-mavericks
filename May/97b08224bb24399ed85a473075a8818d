A pinch of sugar and some butter in the cooking water soothes the bitter taste. Spices like caraway seeds, fennel and anise makes the sprouts more digestible.  Ingredients Serves 4  500g brussels sprouts 2 onions 1 tsp clarified butter 750 ml meat stock Salt & pepper to taste 2g pinch of grated nutmeg 150g crème fraiche  For the dumplings: 1 bunch chives (or 3 tbsp frozen chives), 1 garlic clove, 300g venison mince, 3 tbsp sunflower oil 1 onion 50g all purpose flour Method Clean and wash brussels sprouts. Peel onions and cut into cubes then brown in hot butter in a pot. Add brussels sprouts and pour stock into the pot. Bring to the boil, season with salt and pepper and cook for 12-15 mins on medium heat until sprouts are firm. Stir in creme fraiche and season with nutmeg, salt and pepper. For the dumplings: Rinse chives, dry and cut into small pieces. Peel and cut leftover onion and garlic finely. Mix mince with onions, garlic, flour and half of the chives and knead to form a dough-like consistency. Form little dumplings out of the mince mix and brown them in hot oil. Add them to the soup and simmer for 5 mins. Serve with a sprinkling of chives.
